ROLE

You are well versed in how to build complex models using state of the art machine learning techniques. However, when it comes to describe a complex phenomenon with a simple and interpretable model, you may have no other idea than to ‘hack’ a Gradient Boosting or a Multi Layered Perceptron.

With researchers from ENS-INRIA, Akur8 has built the fundamentals of an optimization technique that is interpretable by design. We bring non-linear penalized regressions to the next level using state of the art optimization advances: if you're curious about the subject, you can take a look at our collaboration paper with a Google AI researcher.

As a data scientist, you will contribute to the design of machine-learning models to enhance risk modelling, demand modelling (probability of potential clients to buy our products or renew their contracts) and price optimization (determine best price to sell the insurance product).

Practically you will begin by :
Reading, understanding and explaining to the team strengths and weaknesses of research papers in ML, algorithmic and optimization;
Implementing pragmatic solutions and test their robustness on our data;
Optimizing your code using Python, to achieve the same performance of open-source packages such as Numpy or Scikit-learn and integrate your findings in production;
Implementing reliable tests, use continuous integration and exploit at best AWS Cloud capabilities with our back-end engineers.
Your work will include :
Relying on a strong understanding of the machine learning methods and optimization techniques used (R&D papers);
Taking into account the business objectives of the models created (in particular: robustness, interpretability and implementation cost);
Designing, building, integrating and maintaining efficient, reusable and reliable code.

Nautilus is building artificial intelligence to advance the efficiency of ocean commerce. We deliver technology to help shipping companies minimize fuel consumption, maximize operational efficiency, and optimize fleet performance. By arming ship owners and operators with real-time predictive decision support, Nautilus is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and making global trade sustainable.

Ocean shipping consumes over $100 billion dollars of fuel every year, and up to 30% of it can be saved. For owner-operators, reliance on manually collected and analyzed data makes it difficult to optimize fleet performance in real-time. By providing a unified data platform that leverages machine learning, Nautilus helps its clients make better decisions to maximize the return on each ship and every voyage. For our clients, this means they drive closer collaboration, greater transparency, and stronger accountability across their global teams every day.

About you.

Nautilus Labs is looking for a data scientist to join our team. You are inquisitive and enjoy exploring new research questions, and are capable of working largely independently. You have a background in data science, physics, naval architecture, mechanical engineering, or other related quantitative field.

Outcomes for this role.

In this role, you will be responsible for conducting analysis of maritime ship and weather data to detect trends and develop predictive models. You will work closely with other data scientists, data analysts, and software engineers to build, test, and deploy robust ship performance models. You will partner with our product team to help conceptualize, design, and implement new machine learning-based products. While we are a collaborative team, you will also be expected to take independent ownership of specific research projects.

Location: Chicago (IL) preferred, San Jose (CA), Newark (NJ), or New York City (NYC)

Braven:

The Challenge

In America, we’ve promised that hard work and ambition will be met with equality of opportunity. The reality is that we have a quiet crisis on our hands. Before COVID-19, an African American with a BA was twice as likely to be unemployed as their white counterpart, and a Bachelor’s degree holder from a low-income background started their career earning only two-thirds as much as those from higher-income backgrounds. While education has the potential to be the great equalizer, only 25% of our country’s 1.2 million first-generation or low-income college enrollees are predicted to land a strong job after graduation and be on a path to the American Dream. And with the COVID-19 crisis upon us, now more than ever, college students from humble beginnings need to be prepared to compete for strong jobs.

Our Vision

We believe that our country’s next generation of leaders will emerge from everywhere, but they need a talent strategy that matches them in strength and diversity. We envision an American Dream Team—100,000 diverse leaders-in-the-making—prepared to access and thrive in strong first jobs after college graduation.

Theory of Action

Braven supports untapped students from college to career by partnering with universities, employers, and college success organizations to offer a two-part experience that begins with a credit-bearing college course followed by a post-course experience that lasts through graduation. Fellows emerge from Braven with the skills, experiences and networks they need to land a strong first job and get on a path to economic freedom. Braven has worked with more than 2,300 students at four campuses at Rutgers University-Newark, San José State, Lehman College, and National Louis University to date.

Outcomes

Braven Fellows across the country are persisting in college and achieving exciting levels of internship and job attainment.
95% of our Fellows are persisting in or have graduated from college.
73% of Braven college graduates have at least one internship during college, compared with 49% of first-generation seniors at large state universities, and Braven Fellows outpace the national average for strong job attainment.
Within six months of graduation, 71% of Fellows secured quality full-time jobs worthy of their Bachelor’s degree or enrolled in graduate school, compared to 56% of all students and 49% of students from similar backgrounds.
We believe Braven is a solution and we are on a mission to scale it, equalizing access to the American Dream.

The Role:

Braven is seeking to hire a self-driven, creative, and disciplined problem-solver to join the Data team as a Data Analyst. The Data Analyst will support the execution and growth of Braven by helping to run, maintain, and improve Braven’s programmatic evaluation systems and processes. Your responsibilities will include data collection, storage, analysis, and reporting. The data you will work with includes program engagement data from our core Accelerator and post-Accelerator programs and a wide range of data on Braven Fellow outcomes, including job and internship attainment, college persistence, and growth in non-cognitive skills.

The ideal candidate for this role should see themselves as equal parts data expert and strategy advisor. You will not only conduct analyses on our programs and outcomes, but you will also translate these findings into insights and recommendations to help inform internal program design and execution. Finally, you will build reports and presentations for external stakeholders such as donors, university and employer partners, and the broader higher education community.

To be successful at Braven during this phase of growth, on the Data team and in this role, you must demonstrate Braven’s core values, be comfortable navigating ambiguity, approach problems with curiosity, have a bias to action, and welcome feedback. You will thrive if you have strong orientation towards team and mission and deep generosity of spirit. This is a fantastic team of awesome people and incredibly meaningful work to be a part of. Come join us in shaping the next generation of leaders!

Programmatic Data Analysis & Evaluation (~50% of time)

You will own some of the data systems that we have built for the purposes of continuously evaluating and assessing our programs. You will also be responsible for troubleshooting and updating these systems to ensure they operate effectively as we scale quickly. Your responsibilities span the entire evaluation workstream, from project design to final analysis and synthesis:
Create project plans to execute on evaluation and analysis priorities, and manage self and others against plans
Help define metrics and KPIs to use as indicators of progress towards organizational goals
Build measurement tools to gather data for metrics (e.g., building and managing surveys, pulling data from Braven’s LMS and Salesforce)
Help design and manage systems, processes, and other team members to efficiently collect data
Analyze collected data and synthesize into reports. Facilitate meetings that ensure findings inform organizational decision-making
Expertly use SQL, Python, and/or Excel to create thoughtful dashboards aligned with Braven’s most important goals and metrics
External Research (~25% of time)

In order to understand and quantify Braven’s impact, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the existing literature relevant to our work.
Research external benchmarks for the outcomes Braven cares most about (e.g. quality job attainment rates for recent college graduates). Note that the exact data points we are interested in are not always readily available, so this requires more than internet research. You may need to contact research institutions or academics directly to ask for specific cuts of data, and you should feel comfortable merging multiple sources of data and making defensible assumptions to arrive at estimates.
Keep close tabs on all research and thought leadership related to Braven’s work (e.g. college enrollment, persistence, the college to career pathway, early career), and synthesize research for team members to inform their work and compel funders and other stakeholders to understand the problem Braven is trying to solve.
Provide Data Support to Program Execution Teams (~25% of time)

Our program teams across our four university partners need data to make their work as effective and efficient as possible. Oftentimes, our support with data collection, management, or analysis can streamline their work in meaningful ways.
Create tools that allow regional teams to process large amounts of data, e.g., matching Braven Fellows and coaches into cohorts, predicting Fellows’ final grades based on their initial assignment submissions
Create external-facing documents that summarize data about our Fellows and Leadership Coaches
Perform ad-hoc analyses to drive day-to-day decision-making (e.g., “Are there any shared characteristics among the group of students who dropped the course after week 1?”)
Experiences, Skills, and Traits

Frequently cited statistics show that women and people from underrepresented groups apply to jobs only if they meet 100% of the qualifications. Braven encourages you to break that statistic and to apply. No one ever meets 100% of the qualifications. We look forward to your application.
BA or equivalent degree required; in a quantitative field and/or with significant statistics coursework
1-3 years of work experience in consulting or another quantitative analytical role ideal
Strong proficiency with Excel required; SQL proficiency strongly preferred
Experience working with basic databases and CRM systems and business intelligence software (e.g. Periscope, Salesforce)
Demonstrates alignment with Braven core values
Ability to create and follow through on project plans with attention to detail and deadlines
Experience managing self and projects to positive outcomes across multiple priorities
Thrives in a fast-paced, team-oriented, start-up environment
Experience working on cross-functional teams
Total Rewards Philosophy:

Braven is committed to attracting and retaining extraordinary, diverse leaders who believe deeply in our mission and uphold our core values as organizational leaders and stewards within and outside of the organization. Braven provides a “total rewards package” that encompasses comprehensive and competitive benefits, compensation, recognition, and career development. Current benefits include: Braven covers 85% of health care costs, has unlimited vacation time, matches up to 5% of your 401K contribution starting your first full month, a paid sabbatical after 4 years on staff, and competitive base salaries based on the midpoint of the market among not-for-profit organizations of similar size. We believe in compensating staff members fairly in relation to each other, their qualifications, and their impact on behalf of the organization and take internal equity seriously. Staff who are meeting expectations generally receive an annual 3% increase. Braven conducts benchmarking every other year; based on this external data, some salaries may also receive market adjustments to keep pace with relevant competition in similar roles. Braven reserves the right to change benefits at any time.

The salary for this position depends on your prior work experience. Please be advised, you will have an opportunity to discuss salary in more detail after you begin the application process.

Braven is an equal opportunity employer and considers qualified applicants for employment without regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, disability, veteran status, or any other protected factor.

About Our Team:

The Data Science Team provides advanced analytical support across VNSNY’s family of corporations. We leverage big data to develop insights and to support strategic decisions for the agency. Meaningful, appropriate use of data is central to the success of our organization. We are looking for an ambitious data scientist to join our team.

About the Role:

The Data Scientist will join a core group of analysts who play an important role in generating strategic insights across the VNSNY organization in these four applications of data science:

Clinical - “Who is going to get sick? What can we do to prevent or mitigate these health events? When is the best time to implement these actions?” This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes.
Quality – “How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members?” Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.
Operational – “How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members?” This application of data science focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses.
Policy – “What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care?” Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while saving money; use predictive modeling to identify high cost and high need patient populations who may be impacted most by changes in health policy.

You Are:

Driven by curiosity and a passion to learn, you thrive in situations where you can bring clarity to ambiguous and multi-faceted problems
A logical thinker who is comfortable learning new programming languages and computing applications independently

Love the challenge of exploring new data sources while practicing a healthy skepticism about data; when you find data that looks wrong, you are emotionally compelled to figure out why
Have a desire to use your analytical skills to make measurable impacts on the lives of patients

Requirements:

MS in statistics, biostatistics, mathematics, econometrics, epidemiology, computer science, or other quantitative field
2+ years of professional experience in applied data analysis, interpretation, and prediction

Strong written and verbal communication and presentation skills, with experience communicating results of complex data analyses to non-technical stakeholders
